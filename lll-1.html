	<p>Local Linked List is a learning group about the use of linked list data structures, used both in the LISP family of programming languages (LISP as in <em>LISt Processor</em>), as well as the hash-linked lists used in P2P systems.</p>
	<p>LLL was initated by André Fincato and Sam Hart, LISP novices, as an opportunity to learn and practice with others.</p>
	<p>For our first event, we'll discuss the <a href="https://twobithistory.org/2018/10/14/lisp.html">history of LISP</a> and the <a href="https://lispcast.com/idea-of-lisp/">5 LISP primitives</a>, drawing from the John McCarthy's 1960 paper, <a href="https://arena-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/3448960/0f545cf2a83df597c67958845fe4c9dd.pdf">Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine, Part 1</a>.</p>
	<p>The event will include a short presentation and basic demo, followed by an open-ended poetic exercise.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Streaming link coming soon.</p>
